freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Pomodoro Clock.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method, the technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
